# fprime-openmct
Scripts to connect the F Prime ground system to OpenMCT

## Installation Instructions.
OpenMCT runs a server using Node JS, so Node must be installed. Node Version 18.17.0 works and is stable with OpenMCT.
### Install NVM (Node Version Manager)
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```
### Install Node 
```
nvm install v18.17.0
nvm alias default v18.17.0 # Make v18.17.0 default if you have multiple Node Versions on your system
```
### Install F-Prime OpenMCT Dependencies and OpenMCT from Source
```
npm install # from the root of the repository
```

The scripts generating the OpenMCT JSON Definitions and polling for real time telemetry use the latest F-Prime GDS API, so it is key to install the latest versions of `fprime_gds` and `fprime_tools`. 
### Install F-Prime GDS(>3.2.0) and F-Prime Tools(>3.2.0)
```
pip install fprime_gds==3.2.0 fprime_tools==3.2.0
```



## Running the F-Prime OpenMCT Pipeline

### Generating the OpenMCT JSON and Initial States
```
cd fprime_scripts
python TopAppDictXMLtoOpenMCTJSON.py --dictionary {path to F-Prime Topology App Dictionary XML}
```

There should now be files called `initial_states.json` and `FPrimeDeploymentTopologyAppDictionary.json` in the root of the repository. 

### Starting the OpenMCT Server
```
npm start # from the root of the repository
```
This command starts up the OpenMCT server with the Telemetry Definitions generated in `FPrimeDeploymentTopologyAppDictionary.json`. Using `initial_states.json`, the server gets initial values for each of the telemetry channels. For real-time telemetry, we must run another script that polls the F-Prime GDS API for telemetry from an F-Prime deployment. 

### Subscribing and Publishing FPrime Telemetry via F-Prime GDS 
To poll for realtime telemetry, we must run `fprime_telem_poller.py`. 
```
cd fprime_scripts
python fprime_telem_poller.py --dictionary {path to F-Prime Topology App Dictionary XML} 
```
Going to `localhost:8080` on a browser will show the F-Prime Telemetry Channels registered in the framework, outputting real time telemetry recieved.
